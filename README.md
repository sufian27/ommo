# OMMO PROJECT

This is a Python library for dealing with HDF5 (Hierarchical Data Format version 5) files and sensor data. 

## About the project

Given an input directory of hdf5 files, outputs two CSV files:

- File 1: contains the average x, y, and z coordinates for each sensor's samples.
- File 2: contains the maximum euclidian distance for each sensor's samples.

## Getting started
